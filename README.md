KianV Linux RISC-V Harris Edition (SOC)
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on 
reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. 
After successfully earning my **HarveyMuddX-ENGR85B** certification, 
I acquired the skills to design a hierarchical RISC-V CPU.

In the previous year, I completed an exam on **Building a RISC-V CPU Core**. 
This experience led me to refine my prior RISC-V SOC, the kianv simple edition. 
This initial endeavor was a significant learning curve, crafted through trial and error without simulation. 
It provided invaluable insights into **logical design** thinking.
